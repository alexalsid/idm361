# Homework

## Beta App
Create a Pre-Beta version of your final project. 
Code all the pages from your designs and add the navigation. Make sure we can navigate through the app. The core functionality is not needed in this version. Just make sure the app matches your design and we can navigate throughout the app. 

**Make sure your app includes:**
- Final images, buttons, etc.
- NO place holder images or text!
- Splash Screen
- App Icon
- Screen navigation functionality
- Zero errors
- Zero warnings


*I'd recommend you work on your app this using MAMP. This will ensure you will not run into some of the same issues I ran into. *
