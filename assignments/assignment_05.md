# Homework

## Beta App
Create a Pre-Beta version of your final project. 
Code all the pages from your designs and add the navigation. Make sure we can navigate throughout the app. Use placeholder text/images where it makes sense.

The core functionality is **not** needed in this version. Just make sure the app matches your design and we can navigate it. 

**Make sure your app includes:**
- Splash Screen
- App Icon
- Add 2 home screen functionality
- Screen navigation functionality
- Zero errors
- Zero warnings


_I'd recommend you work on your app this using MAMP when working locally. This will ensure you will not run into some of the same issues I ran into._

## How to Submit
